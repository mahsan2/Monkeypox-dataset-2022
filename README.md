# Monkeypox-dataset-2022

During the Onset of Monkeypox disease our aim is to develop a image-based dataset that will assist to develop Artificial Intelligence based disease diagnosis model.

| Dataset Name | Total Images |
| ---           | ---         |
|Monkeypox     | 43|
|Monkeypox_augmented | 587 |
|Normal | 54|
|Normal_augmented | 552|
| Chickenpox    |  47         |
| Chickenpox_augmented | 329  |
| Measles       |  17 |
| Measles_augmented | 286 |
|Total | 1915|

<h2> Data folder such as Chickenpox_gray, Monekypox_gray contains gray image of the original images which might help to reduce the time computation during the training.</h2>
